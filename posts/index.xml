You should check the CKAN docs - they&amp;rsquo;re pretty awesome.
Although the CKAN extension documentation is fairly complete I thought it might be useful to document some examples for each of the plugin interfaces that are available to you as a CKAN extension author. They&amp;rsquo;re not going to be fully complete plugin examples, they already exist, but rather just more basic guidance on what you can do with each plugin and how.</description></item></channel></rss>
